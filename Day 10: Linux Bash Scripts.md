#üìå Task:
The production support team of **xFusionCorp Industries** required a bash script to automate the backup of website files on **App Server 1**.  
The script should:
1. Create a zip archive of the `/var/www/html/official` directory.
2. Save the archive inside `/backup/` on **App Server 1**.
3. Copy the archive to the **Nautilus Backup Server** at `/backup/` location.
4. Ensure no password prompt while copying (using SSH key-based authentication).
5. Avoid using `sudo` inside the script.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenge Faced:
While starting, the **zip package was not installed** on the server.  
Since `zip` is essential for creating compressed archives, it had to be installed manually before proceeding.

```bash
# Install zip package
sudo yum install -y zip     # For RHEL/CentOS
# OR
sudo apt-get install -y zip # For Ubuntu/Debian
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps :

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to App Server:
```bash
ssh banner@stapp01 #replace server given to you
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to Scripts Directory:
```bash
cd /scripts
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Backup Script:

Created a script named official_backup.sh.

```bash
vi official_backup.sh #replace the script name given for you.
```
Added the following content:

Note: "change the file names as given to you !!"
```bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
echo "zip archiving file.."
zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_official.zip /var/www/html/official

echo "copying zip archive..."
scp /backup/xfusioncorp_official.zip clint@stbkp01:/backup

echo "successfully backed up"
```
Save and exit:

```ruby
:wq
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Make Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x official_backup.sh
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Setup SSH Key Authentication

To avoid password prompts during SCP:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
- Here Just press the "Enter" button for the following...

Then run:
```bash
ssh-copy-id clint@stbkp01 #replce with your backup server
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script

```bash
./official_backup.sh

(or)

bash official_backup.sh
```

### ‚úÖ Verification

Checked if the zip archive was created in /backup/ on Backup App Server 1:

Exit from the current server and login to Backup Server:
```bash
ssh clint@stbkp01
```

Now then run this command and that backup file that you created in App server is showing here:

```bash
ls -la /backup/
```
Verified the archive exists on Nautilus Backup Server in /backup/:

```bash
ssh clint@stbkp01 "ls -l /backup/"
```
