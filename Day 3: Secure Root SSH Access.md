# Task: Disable Direct SSH Root Login on All App Servers

## Objective
Following security audits, the **xFusionCorp Industries** security team has restricted direct root SSH login.  
Your task is to **disable direct SSH root login** on all app servers in the **Stratos Datacenter**.

---

## Steps

### 1. SSH into the Target Server
Connect to the server as a non-root user (e.g., `tony`).
```bash
ssh tony@stapp01
```
-Replace stapp01 with the correct server hostname or IP address.

-Enter the user password when prompted.

----

### 2. Switch to Root User

Once logged in, elevate privileges to root.

```bash
sudo su -
```
`sudo` - "Superuser do"

`su` - "Switch User"

`-` - hyphen signifies "Login Shell"

- You’ll need to enter the password for the non-root user (tony in this case).

---

### 3. Edit the SSH Configuration File

Open the SSH daemon configuration file with vi editor.

```bash
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Locate the line:
```shell
#PermitRootLogin yes
```
Change it to:
```nginx
PermitRootLogin no
```

If the line is commented (# at the start), remove the #.

Save and exit in vi:

```ruby
use "i" to insert
Esc - to backstate

:wq -where "w" to write and "q" to exit
Enter
```

----

### 4. Test the SSH Configuration
Before applying changes, ensure there are no syntax errors.

```bash
sshd -t
```
- If there’s no output, it means there are no configuration errors.

- If an error appears, fix it before restarting the service.

----

### 5. Restart the SSH Service
Apply the changes by restarting the SSH service.

```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

To Check Status:
```
systemctl status sshd
```

### Exit the Server

After completing the task, to exit the server 

```
exit or logout
```
